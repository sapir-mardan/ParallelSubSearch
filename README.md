# ParallelSubSearch

ParallelSubSearch is a Python project designed to illustrate and explore the algorithmic design and parallelization of functions to find the longest contiguous sub-sequence within a sequence. This project includes a performance comparison between serial and parallel execution approaches.

## Description

The project consists of two main parts:
1. **Algorithmic Design**: Implementing functions `longest_contiguous` and `all_longest` to find specific types of sub-sequences within provided data.
2. **Parallel Execution**: Enhancing performance by implementing a parallel approach to process large datasets using Python's `concurrent.futures` module.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pytest for running unit tests

### Installing

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ParallelSubSearch.git
